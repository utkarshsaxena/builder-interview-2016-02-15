Thank you for considering me as a prospective front-end engineer at Unbounce. It was a fun experience building a racing game.
I attempted my best to follow the style guide and write well factored code so that it self-documents itself. There is definitely room
for improvement. Looking forward to hearing your feedback and discussing with you how the solution can be improved.

Thank again for your time and effort.
